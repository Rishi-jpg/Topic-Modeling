(In your\\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\\nFriday\\'s New York Times reported that this group definitely is\\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\\n\\n\\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\\n\\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\\n\\t  brings the death penalty.  \\n\\n\\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn\\'t he Ilyess?\\n\\n\\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\\n\\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\\n\\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\\n\\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\\n\\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\\n\\t  prostitutes.\\n\\n\\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I\\'ve\\n\\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\\n\\t  has no basis in the Qur\\'an, the ahadith, etc.\\n\\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\\n\\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \\n\\n\\t  If I were you, I\\'d choose my heroes wisely,\\n\\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\\n\\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\\n\\n\\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\\n\\n\\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\\n\\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\\nlast six months or so I\\'ve read there have been stepped up harassing\\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I\\'ve read that\\nthey\\'ve cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious\\ngatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers\\noffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who\\ndare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the\\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they\\'re just a small\\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\\nSaud, like they\\'re trying to in the long run.\\n\\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\\nwant, Ilyess?\\n\\n--\\nDave Bakken\\n==>\"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don\\'t know what\\n    to do with her husband.\" James Carville (Clinton campaign strategist),2/93\\n==>\"Oh, please call Daddy.
